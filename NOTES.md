# Notes

## Camera labels versus internal names

The default on-screen camera (internally the “SE camera”, `HOUSE_CAMERA`,
`flipped = False`) looks **north**. The opposite view (internally the flip /
“NW” camera, `V` / `flipped = True`) looks **south**.

On-screen copy now says “looking north” / “looking south”. Internal
identifiers and wall names (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, `drawing_r`, comments about
the south-east camera, and so on) keep the old labels so layouts, ghosting
and depth sorting stay untouched.
